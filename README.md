# Fresh
XFCE theme, square and simple

Based heavily upon 'Plain' by IZT (https://www.xfce-look.org/p/1016183/)


## Installation Instructions ##

Pretty straight forward:
* `git clone https://github.com/mintsoft/Fresh.git ~/.local/share/themes`

This should create `~/.local/share/themes/Fresh/xfwm4` and should now appear as selectable in `Settings` -> `Window Manager`
